# Part II - Key values
I'm able to create a hash map and I can add information to it.  
I'm able to fetch information from a hash map and I know what happens if the information is not found.  
I know what methods equals and hashCode are used for.  
I'm able to use a list as an value in a Hash Map.  
I know what is a superclass and what is a subclass.  
I am able to create a class that inherits from a different class.  
I know how to call methods and the constructor from a superclass.  
I know what the concept interface means.  
I am able to create a class that implement a interface.  
I am able to create my own interfaces.  
I am able to represent all objects with at least two different types.  
I'm able to process data using streams.  
I'm able to use Java's built-in Comparable interface.  
I'm able to sort a list of objects using Java's built-in tools.  
I'm able to use enumerated types.  
I'm able to write regular expressions.  
I know cases where using an iterator is beneficial.  
I know what class diagrams are and I'm able to draw class diagrams that contains a couple of classes.  
I'm able to create classes from a given class diagram.  
I know how to catch exceptions in my programs.  
I know some exceptions that don't need catching.  
I can write a program that writes text to a file.  
I know what a type parameter means.  
I can create classes that contains objects, whose type can be defined with type parameter(s).  
I can create a data structure that resembles ArrayList.  
I can create a data structure that resembles HashMap.  
I can generate random numbers by using existing Java libraries.  
I can create and use multi-dimensional arrays.  
# Part I - Key values
I know some repeating programming problems and solutions to them.  
I'm familiar with the term call stack, and I know how program execution advances when a method is called.  
I know why variables and methods should be named descriptively.  
I know what object-oriented programming is.  
I know what overloading means, and I can overload methods and constructors.  
I know how primitive and reference variables work when used as method parameters.  
I can define equals() method that is used to compare objects of the same type with each other.  
I can define a reference-type object variable for a class.  
I can use an object as a method parameter and as a method's return value.  
I know how to use lists as instance variables.  
I can write a program where an object is retrieved from an instance variable list.  
I know it's a good idea to separate the user interface and the program logic.  
I can write unit tests.  
I'm aware what the concept of test-driven development means.  
I know how selection sort works.  
I'm able to describe how binary search works.  
When solving more open-ended programming assignments, I'm thinking what kind of classes and objects would help me with solving the exercise.
